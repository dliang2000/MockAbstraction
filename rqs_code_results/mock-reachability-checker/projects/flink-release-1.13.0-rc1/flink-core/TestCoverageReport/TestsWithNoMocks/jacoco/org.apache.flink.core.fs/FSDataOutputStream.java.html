 * and for fault tolerance and recovery. It is therefore crucial that the persistence semantics of
 * these streams are well defined.

 * persistence via Flink's FileSystem abstraction and the {@code FSDataOutputStream}.
 *

 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Implementations of the {@code FSDataOutputStream} are generally not assumed to be thread safe.
 * Instances of {@code FSDataOutputStream} should not be passed between threads, because there are
 * no guarantees about the order of visibility of operations across threads.
