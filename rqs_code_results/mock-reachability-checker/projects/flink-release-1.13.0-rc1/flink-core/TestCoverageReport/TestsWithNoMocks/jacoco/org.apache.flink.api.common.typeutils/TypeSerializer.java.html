/**
 * This interface describes the methods that are required for a data type to be handled by the Flink
 * runtime. Specifically, this interface contains the serialization and copying methods.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The methods in this class are not necessarily thread safe. To avoid unpredictable side
 * effects, it is recommended to call {@code duplicate()} method and use one serializer instance per
 * thread.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upgrading TypeSerializers to the new TypeSerializerSnapshot model&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This section is relevant if you implemented a TypeSerializer in Flink versions up to 1.6 and
 * want to adapt that implementation to the new interfaces that support proper state schema
 * evolution, while maintaining backwards compatibility. Please follow these steps:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;Change the type serializer's config snapshot to implement {@link TypeSerializerSnapshot},
 *       rather than extending {@code TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot} (as previously).
 *   &lt;li&gt;If the above step was completed, then the upgrade is done. Otherwise, if changing to
 *       implement {@link TypeSerializerSnapshot} directly in-place as the same class isn't possible
 *       (perhaps because the new snapshot is intended to have completely different written contents
 *       or intended to have a different class name), retain the old serializer snapshot class
 *       (extending {@code TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot}) under the same name and give the updated
 *       serializer snapshot class (the one extending {@code TypeSerializerSnapshot}) a new name.
 *   &lt;li&gt;Override the {@code
 *       TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot#resolveSchemaCompatibility(TypeSerializer)} method to perform
 *       the compatibility check based on configuration written by the old serializer snapshot
 *       class.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The data type that the serializer serializes.
