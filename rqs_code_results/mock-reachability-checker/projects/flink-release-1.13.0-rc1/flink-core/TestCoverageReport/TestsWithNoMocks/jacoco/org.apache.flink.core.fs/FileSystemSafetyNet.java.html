/**
 * The FileSystemSafetyNet can be used to guard a thread against {@link FileSystem} stream resource
 * leaks. When activated for a thread, it tracks all streams that are opened by FileSystems that the
 * thread obtains. The safety net has a global cleanup hook that will close all streams that were
 * not properly closed.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The main thread of each Flink task, as well as the checkpointing thread are automatically
 * guarded by this safety net.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; This safety net works only for streams created by Flink's FileSystem
 * abstraction, i.e., for {@code FileSystem} instances obtained via {@link FileSystem#get(URI)} or
 * through {@link Path#getFileSystem()}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; When a guarded thread obtains a {@code FileSystem} or a stream and passes
 * them to another thread, the safety net will close those resources once the former thread
 * finishes.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The safety net can be used as follows:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * class GuardedThread extends Thread {
 *
 *     public void run() {
 *         FileSystemSafetyNet.initializeSafetyNetForThread();
 *         try {
 *             // do some heavy stuff where you are unsure whether it closes all streams
 *             // like some untrusted user code or library code
 *         }
 *         finally {
 *             FileSystemSafetyNet.closeSafetyNetAndGuardedResourcesForThread();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
