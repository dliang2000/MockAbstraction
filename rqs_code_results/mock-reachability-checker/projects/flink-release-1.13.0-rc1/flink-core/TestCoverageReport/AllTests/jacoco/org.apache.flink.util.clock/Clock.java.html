/**
 * A clock that gives access to time. This clock returns two flavors of time:
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Absolute Time&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This refers to real world wall clock time, and it is typically derived from a system clock. It
 * is subject to clock drift and inaccuracy, and can jump if the system clock is adjusted. Absolute
 * time behaves similar to {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Relative Time&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This time advances at the same speed as the &lt;i&gt;absolute time&lt;/i&gt;, but the timestamps can only
 * be referred to relative to each other. The timestamps have no absolute meaning and cannot be
 * compared across JVM processes. The source for the timestamps is not affected by adjustments to
 * the system clock, so it never jumps. Relative time behaves similar to {@link System#nanoTime()}.
