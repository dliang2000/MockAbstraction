/**
 * This class is a guard for shared resources with the following invariants. The resource can be
 * acquired by multiple clients in parallel through the {@link #acquireResource()} call. As a result
 * of the call, each client gets a {@link Lease}. The {@link #close()} method of the lease releases
 * the resources and reduces the client count in the {@link ResourceGuard} object. The protected
 * resource should only be disposed once the corresponding resource guard is successfully closed,
 * but the guard can only be closed once all clients that acquired a lease for the guarded resource
 * have released it. Before this is happened, the call to {@link #close()} will block until the
 * zero-open-leases condition is triggered. After the resource guard is closed, calls to {@link
 * #acquireResource()} will fail with exception. Notice that, obviously clients are responsible to
 * release the resource after usage. All clients are considered equal, i.e. there is only a global
 * count maintained how many times the resource was acquired but not by whom.
