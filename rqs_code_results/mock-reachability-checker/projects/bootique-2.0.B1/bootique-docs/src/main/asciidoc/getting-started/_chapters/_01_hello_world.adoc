== Hello World in Bootique

The goal of this chapter is to write a simple REST app using Bootique.
Let's start with a new Java Maven project created in your favorite IDE.
Your `pom.xml` in addition to the required project information tags will need to declare a few BOM ("Bill of Material") imports in the `&lt;dependencyManagement/&gt;` section:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.bootique.bom</groupId>
      <artifactId>bootique-bom</artifactId>
      <version>{bootique_version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

This will allow `<dependencies/>` section that will follow shortly to include various Bootique modules and not worry about their individual versions.
So let's create this section and import a few modules:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.bootique.jersey</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootique-jersey</artifactId>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.bootique.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootique-logback</artifactId>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

As you see we want a `bootique-jersey` and `bootique-logback` modules in our app.
Those may depend on other modules, but we don't have to think about it.
Those dependencies will be included by Maven automatically. Now let's create the main Java class that will run the app:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../test/java/com/foo/Application.java[tags=Main]
----

There's only one line of meaningful code inside the `main()` method, but this is already a working Bootique app.
Meaning it is runnable and can do a few things. So let's try running this class from your IDE.
You will see the output like this on the IDE console:

[source]
----
NAME
      com.foo.Application

OPTIONS
      -c yaml_location, --config=yaml_location
           Specifies YAML config location, which can be a file path or a URL.

      -h, --help
           Prints this message.

      -H, --help-config
           Prints information about application modules and their configuration
           options.

      -s, --server
           Starts Jetty server.
----

So the app printed its help message telling us which commands and options it understands.
`--server` option looks promising, but before we use it, let's actually write a REST endpoint that will answer to our requests.
We'll use standard Java https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services[JAX-RS API] for that:

[source,java]
----
include::../../../../test/java/com/foo/HelloResource.java[tags=HelloResource]
----

Note that we could have placed this code straight in the Main class.
Which makes for an effective demo (an app that can fit in one class), but not for a particularly clean design.
So keeping the resource in its own class. Now let's amend the `Main` class to tell Bootique where to find the resource:

[source,java]
----
include::../../../../test/java/com/foo/Application.java[tags=Application]
----

Here we created our own module that "contributes" resource configuration to the JerseyModule.
Now let's try to run the app with the changes. Add `--server` to the command run parameters before doing it.
Now when the app is started, you will see different output:

[source]
----
INFO main o.e.jetty.util.log: Logging initialized @1328ms
INFO main i.b.j.s.ServerFactory: Adding listener io.bootique.jetty.servlet.DefaultServletEnvironment
INFO main i.b.j.s.ServletFactory: Adding servlet 'jersey' mapped to /*
INFO main i.b.j.s.ServerLifecycleLogger: Starting jetty...
INFO main o.e.j.server.Server: jetty-9.4.19.v20190610
INFO main o.e.j.s.h.ContextHandler: Started o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@27dc79f7{/,null,AVAILABLE}
INFO main o.e.j.s.ServerConnector: Started ServerConnector@3a45c42a{HTTP/1.1,[http/1.1]}{0.0.0.0:8080}
INFO main o.e.j.server.Server: Started @2005ms
INFO main i.b.j.s.ServerLifecycleLogger: Started Jetty in 584 ms. Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/
----

Notice that the app did not terminate immediately, and is waiting for user requests.
Now let's try opening the URL http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/] in the browser.
We should see 'Hello, world!' as request output. We just built a working REST app that does not require deployment to a web container,
and generally wasn't that hard to write. The takeaway here is this:

* You start the app via `Bootique` class, that gives you a runnable "shell" of your future app in one line of code.
* Declaring modules in the app dependencies and using `Bootique.autoLoadModules()`
gives the app the ability to respond to commands from those modules
(in our example `--server` command coming from implicit bootique-jetty module started an embedded web server ).
* You can contribute your own code to modules to build an app with desired behavior.

Next we'll talk about configuration...
