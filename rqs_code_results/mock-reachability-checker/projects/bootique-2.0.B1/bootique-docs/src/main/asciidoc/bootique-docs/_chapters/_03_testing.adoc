== Testing

=== Bootique and Testing

NOTE: Bootique provides integration for both JUnit 4 and JUnit 5. Both can even be combined in the same project via
JUnit 5 https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4-running["vintage engine"]. This chapter
will focus on JUnit 5 instructions. For JUnit 4 docs, please check documentation for Bootique 1.x.

Bootique is uniquely suitable to be used as a test framework. Within a single test it allows you to start and stop
multiple in-process runtimes, each with Ð° distinct set of modules and configurations. Bootique test facilities are
controlled with a small number of annotations: `@BQTest`, `@BQTestTool` and `@BQApp`, that will be described below.

This chapter is about the core test framework. For module-specific test APIs (e.g. `bootique-jdbc-junit5`,
`bootique-jetty-junit5`), check documentation of those modules. They all follow the same base principles
described here.

To start using Bootique test extensions, import the following module in the "test" scope:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.bootique</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootique-junit5</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Each test class using Bootique extensions must be annotated with `@BQTest`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/MyTest.java[tag=BQTest]
----

Doing that tells Bootique to manage lifecycle of test `BQRuntimes` and test "tools".

[#bqruntime]
=== Test BQRuntimes

`BQRuntime` is an object representing an entire app (i.e. an object whose state and behavior you are checking in your
test). You can declare `BQRuntime` as a static field of the test class, initialize it the way you would initialize an
application (yes, using the same factory method from `Bootique` class), and annotate with `@BQApp` to let Bootique
start and stop it when appropriate:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/BQAppTest.java[tag=BQApp]
----

The "app" will be started by Bootique before all the tests in this class, and will be shutdown after all the tests are
finished. You can declare any number of such "apps" within a test to emulate fairly complex systems. And as you can
see in the example, you can pass any command or configuration as arguments to the `app(..)` method (that emulates a
command-line invocation).

Sometimes you just need a runtime instance, and do not want to execute any commands. For this case use `@BQApp(skipRun=true)`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/BQAppNoRunTest.java[tag=BQApp]
----

=== Test Tools and Scopes

Bootique provides a number of test tools that help you customize the apps for the test environment
(e.g. `TcDbTester` tool from `bootique-jdbc-junit5-testcontainers` starts a test database and supplies a "module" to
the app with DataSource
configuration to access that DB; `JettyTester` from `bootique-jetty` configures HTTP connector to listen on a random
unoccupied port and provides a Java client to send requests to the server, etc.).

Tools are declared as fields in a test class, each annotated with `@BQTestTool`. A tool can exist in a certain
scope (as defined by `@BQTestTool(value=...)`. "Scope" determines when the tool is initialized and shutdown during
the test. The following scopes are available:

* `BQTestScope.TEST_CLASS`: A scope of a single test class. Roughly corresponds to `@BeforeAll` / `@AfterAll` from JUnit.
All tools in this scope must be declared as static variables.
* `BQTestScope.TEST_METHOD`: A scope of a single test method. Roughly corresponds to `@BeforeEach` / `@AfterEach` from JUnit.
* `BQTestScope.GLOBAL`: Allows a given tool to be shared with more than one test class. JUnit has no analog of a "global"
scope, but it is quite useful for expensive reusable resources (e.g. Docker containers), so Bootique supports it for all
the tools.
* `BQTestScope.IMPLIED`: This is the default scope of `@BQTestTool`. If the field is static it is equivalent to
`TEST_CLASS`, if non-static - `TEST_METHOD`. This way most of the time you don't need to explicitly define the scope,
but just need to declare your tool as static or instance variable.

Some examples:

----

----

=== BQTestFactory Tool

A very common test tool is `BQTestFactory`. It allows to create and run `BQRuntimes` on the fly inside test class
methods, and as such is a more flexible alternative to `@BQApp` annotation:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/MyTest.java[tag=TestFactory]
----

`BQTestFactory.app()` does roughly the same
thing as `Bootique.app()`, with an important difference that all created runtimes will be automatically shut down at the
end of the factory scope. E.g. in the following example `testFactory` would shut down any runtimes created in each
test method right after that method finishes (since `testFactory` is an instance variable, the default scope is
`TEST_METHOD`):

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/MyTest.java[tag=TestAbc]
----

If you need the runtime instance to poke inside the app's DI container, you can call `createRuntime()` instead of
`run()`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/MyTest.java[tag=TestXyz]
----
`BQRuntime` of course has its own `run()` method, so you can both inspect the runtime and run a command.

=== Common Test Scenarios

Among the things that can be tested are runtime services with real dependencies, standard output of full Bootique
applications (i.e. the stuff that would be printed to the console if this were a real app), network services using
real network connections (e.g. your REST API's), and so on. Some examples are given below, outlining the common
techniques.

==== Testing Injectable Services

Services can be obtained from test runtime, their methods called, and assertions made about the results of the call:

include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/InjectableTest.java[tag=Testing]
----

==== Testing Network Services

If a test command starts a web server or some other network service, it can be accessed via a URL right after running
the server. E.g.:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/NetworkTest.java[tag=Testing]
----

==== Testing Commands

You can run the app in the test and check the values of the exit code and `stdin` and `stderr` contents:

----
include::../../../../test/java/io/bootique/docs/testing/CommandTest.java[tag=Testing]
----

==== Testing Module Validity

When you are writing your own modules, you may want to check that they are configured properly for autoloading
(i.e. `META-INF/services/io.bootique.BQModuleProvider` is present in the expected place and contains the right provider.
There's a helper class to check for it:
