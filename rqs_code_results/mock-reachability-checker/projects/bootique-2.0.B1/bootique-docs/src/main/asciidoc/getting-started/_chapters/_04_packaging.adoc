== Packaging

Till now we've been running our app from IDE (which also happened to be much easier than running typical container-aware apps).
Now let's package our app as a runnable "fat" jar to be able to run it from command line (e.g. in deployment environment).
Assembling "fat" jar requires a bit of configuration of the Maven `maven-shade-plugin`.
To simplify it, you can set a parent of your `pom.xml` to be a standard Bootique parent:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>io.bootique.parent</groupId>
    <artifactId>bootique-parent</artifactId>
    <version>{bootique_parent_version}</version>
</parent>
----

Other required `pom.xml` additions:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <main.class>com.foo.Application</main.class>
</properties>
----

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

Once this is setup you can build and run the app:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package

# Using myapp-1.0.jar as an example; the actual jar name depends on your POM settings
java -jar target/myapp-1.0.jar --server --config=myconfig.yml
----

The result should be the same as running from the IDE,
and the app should be still accessible at http://localhost:10001/hello[http://localhost:10001/hello].
Now your jar can be deployed in any environment that has Java 8.

This concludes our simple tutorial.
